This is a big Unity project in which I implemented game mechanics needed to make an RPG game.
I made a map out of square tiles with collisions on walls, placed NPCs and implemented an NPC dialogue system using nodes.
I also simulate the enemy vision using raycast cones, so it is possible to sneak behind their backs.
Enemies use A* pathfinding to traverse the map and can then shoot at the player.
When an enemy loses sight of a player behind a corner, they will enter an investigative mode searching for the player around nearby obstacles.
After implementing all the mechanics that I found interesting - I moved onto other projects.
I don't usually finish games - it's about the journey :)
